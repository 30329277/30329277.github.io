            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>CNC Workpiece Calculator is an offline machining utility. The app does not ask you to create an account, does not connect to external services, and does not transmit any information outside of your device.</p>

            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No personal information, contact details, or identifiers are collected.</li>

                <li>No location data, photos, microphone, or camera access is requested.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>On-Device Processing</h2>
            <p>All centering, tolerance, fit, and weight calculations occur entirely on your iPhone or iPad. Inputs remain in volatile memory only for the duration of your session and are not uploaded, synced, or stored on remote servers.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The app contains professional machining references and is safe for all ages because it does not collect any data. Parents and guardians can use the app without additional configuration.</p>
